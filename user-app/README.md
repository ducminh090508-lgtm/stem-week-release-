A standalone terminal-based application for teams to participate in STEM Week competitions.

## Features

- **Live Leaderboard**: View team standings and rankings

## Quick Start

### Windows

1. Extract the user-app folder
2. Open Command Prompt and navigate to the user-app folder
3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Update `config.ini` with your server IP address
5. Run the app:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```
   or double-click `run.bat`

### macOS / Linux

1. Extract the user-app folder
2. Open Terminal and navigate to the user-app folder
3. Ensure you have the `python3-venv` package installed (e.g. `sudo apt install python3-venv`).
4. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   *(or simply run `./run.sh` which installs automatically)*
5. Update `config.ini` with your server IP address
6. Make launcher executable once:
   ```sh
   chmod +x run.sh
   ```
7. Run the app:
   ```sh
   ./run.sh
   ```
   or `python3 main.py`

> The launcher will create a `.venv` directory on first run and install all dependencies inside it, avoiding system-wide package installs.

## Configuration

Edit `config.ini` to set your server connection:

```ini
[server]
ip = 192.168.1.100      # Change to your server IP
port = 8080             # Change if using a different port
```
